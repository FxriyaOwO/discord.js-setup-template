Welcome to the discord.JS template! Sorry it's short, I was in a rush while making this-

# Downloading Packages
Type 'npm init -y' in your code editor's terminal
 Go to your code editor's terminal, type 'npm install discord.js' to install discord.JS. (Type it w/ out quotations)
 
# Downloading Packages on glitch.com
Open your glitch project, go to the 'package.json' file and click 'Add package'. Search up 'discord.js' and click on the first option when it pops up. BOOM, you have installed discord.js package

# Downloading Packages on repl.it
You won't need to download the package, repl.it will do it for you. If you do want to, go to the 'Shell' and type 'npm install discord.js' and you have installed discord.js package.
